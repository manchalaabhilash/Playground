# MultimodalRAG Architecture

This document provides an overview of the MultimodalRAG system architecture, its components, and how they interact.

## System Overview

MultimodalRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that supports both text and image modalities. It enables users to query a knowledge base containing documents and images, retrieving relevant information and generating responses using large language models (LLMs).

## Core Components

### 1. Data Processing

#### Text Processing
- **DocumentProcessor**: Handles text document ingestion, parsing, and chunking
- Supports various file formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Implements text chunking strategies for optimal retrieval

#### Image Processing
- **ImageProcessor**: Handles image ingestion, feature extraction, and OCR
- Extracts text from images using OCR
- Generates captions and metadata for images

### 2. Embedding Generation

#### Text Embeddings
- **TextEmbeddingModel**: Generates vector representations of text
- Supports various embedding models (OpenAI, Sentence Transformers)
- Optimized for semantic similarity matching

#### Image Embeddings
- **ImageEmbeddingModel**: Generates vector representations of images
- Extracts visual features using vision models
- Enables similarity search for images

### 3. Vector Database

- **MultimodalVectorDB**: Stores and indexes embeddings for both text and images
- Supports similarity search across modalities
- Implements filtering and metadata-based retrieval

### 4. Retrieval System

#### Text Retrieval
- **TextRetriever**: Retrieves relevant text documents based on queries
- Implements semantic search using embeddings
- Supports hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword)

#### Image Retrieval
- **ImageRetriever**: Retrieves relevant images based on queries
- Implements visual similarity search
- Supports metadata and OCR text-based retrieval

#### Multimodal Retrieval
- **MultimodalRetriever**: Combines text and image retrieval
- Implements fusion strategies for cross-modal retrieval
- Dynamically adjusts retrieval based on query type

### 5. Reranking

- **CrossEncoderReranker**: Improves retrieval precision using cross-encoders
- **SemanticReranker**: Reranks results based on semantic similarity
- **HybridReranker**: Combines multiple reranking strategies

### 6. LLM Integration

- **MultimodalLLM**: Interfaces with LLM providers
- Formats prompts with multimodal context
- Handles response generation and post-processing

### 7. API Layer

- RESTful API for system interaction
- Endpoints for initialization, document upload, and querying
- Authentication and rate limiting

### 8. User Interface

- Web-based UI for system interaction
- File upload and management
- Query interface and response visualization

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion Flow**:
   - Documents/images uploaded via API/UI
   - Processing pipeline extracts content and features
   - Embeddings generated and stored in vector database

2. **Query Flow**:
   - User submits query via API/UI
   - Query analyzed to determine modality focus
   - Relevant documents/images retrieved from vector database
   - Retrieved content reranked for relevance
   - Context formatted and sent to LLM
   - LLM generates response
   - Response returned to user

## Deployment Architecture

The system is containerized using Docker, with separate containers for:
- API service
- UI service
- Vector database
- LLM service (if self-hosted)

Docker Compose orchestrates the deployment, with configuration via environment variables.

## Security Considerations

- API authentication using API keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure storage of credentials and API keys
- CORS configuration for web security
